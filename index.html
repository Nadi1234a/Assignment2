                <p class="k">Feeling used, but I'm still missing you <br>
                And I can't see the end of this <br>
                <br>
                Just wanna feel your kiss....Against my lips....And now all this time....Is passing by <span class="A">(uh-huh)</span><br>
                But I still can't seem to tell you why <br>
                It hurts me every time I see you<br>
                Realize how much I need you </p>

                <p class = vocal>[Olivia o'brien:]</p>
                <p class="N">I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I love you<br>
                Don't want to, but I can't put<br>
                Nobody else above you<br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I want you<br>
                You want her, you need her<br>
                And I'll never be her</p>

                <p class = vocal>[Gnash:]</p>
                <P class="k">I miss you when I can't sleep <span class="A">(uh-huh)</span><br>
                Or right after coffee...Or right when I can't eat <br>
                I miss you in my front seat...Still got sand in my sweaters<br>
                From nights we don't remember...Do you miss me like I miss you?<br>
                Fucked around and got attached to you<br>
                Friends can break your heart too, and<br>
                I'm always tired but never of you<br>
                If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit<br>
                I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit<br>
                I type a text but then I nevermind that shit<br>
                I got these feelings but you never mind that shit<br>
                Oh oh, keep it on the low<br>
                You're still in love with me but your friends don't know<br>
                If u wanted me you would just say so<br>
                And if I were you, I would never let me go</P>
